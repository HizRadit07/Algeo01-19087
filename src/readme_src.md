This 'src' folder contains main source code used in the program.

Besides functions and procedures used in the program, there is also a main_menu.java file in which the Main Program is coded.
While in this folder, make sure to first compile the file before trying to run it.
If you want to test the program using input files from the 'test' folder, or one you make yourself, make sure to put it here.
